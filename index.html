It all started one rainy Saturday. I was stuck inside with nothing to do so I fired up my laptop and began to browse the web. I don't know why but for some reason I started to read articles on HACKERS and how they STEAL people's information to commit CRIMES. What started as a simple curiosity on a boring day soon started growing into an obsession I couldn't control. I was falling down the rabbit hole and I didn't know where it would end.

Before I knew it all I could think about was how to protect my PRIVACY and SECURITY online. I didn't want to end up like those people in the stories I'd been reading, who had been publicly HUMILIATED, STOLEN FROM or even worse' I was determined to learn all I could to keep myself and my friends and family safe online, and so it began for three weeks all I could think about was how to better protect myself.

The first thing I discovered is that EVERYONE is a TARGET for hackers. Not just corporations and secretive government departments but EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE INTERNET! At first I found this hard to believe until I read about BOTNETS. These are 'Networks of Robot Software' that are created by hacking on to someone's computer and installing software called a BOT that allows the creator to use your computer for anything they want! But it gets worse, bots can be installed when you install PIRATE SOFTWARE or even just when you click on a bad link. That's when I realised OK is NOT OK and I should probably READ and UNDERSTAND any message that comes up on my screen before I click OK. I decided in that first week I'd click CANCEL on anything I didn't understand from now on.

It seems that I don't have to have anything interesting on my computers for HACKERS to be able to use it to commit CRIME!

Even worse it seems that if my computer was to be used for crime it might look like it was me doing it rather than some evil-doer on the other side of the planet, and it might take years to prove that I was innocent, if at all!
